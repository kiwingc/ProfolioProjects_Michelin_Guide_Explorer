**Insights**
1. According to the Top 10 Michelin Restaurants by city, as expected, the cities belong to first world, developed countries.
2. Surprisingly, the most popular cuisine in Michelin Restaurants is "Modern Cuisine" instead of the world famous cuisines such as italian, french and british.
3. 1-star Michelin restaurants outnumber 3-star Michelin restaurants by a significant margin, reflecting the increasing difficulty in achieving higher star ratings.
4. Price is not related to the rating of Michelin Star.
